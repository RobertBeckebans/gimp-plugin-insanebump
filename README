GIMP Plug-In InsaneBump
=======================

Copyright (C) 2013  Derby Russell <jdrussell51@gmail.org>


This package is a plug-in for GIMP 2.0. It features all the
nice things a good GIMP plug-in should have:

- The source is separated in main/interface/render files (core/ui separation).
- It's prepared for I18N.
- It installs it's own help files.
- Full autoconf/automake support.
- A dialog with examples of all libgimp widgets.


To build and install it, just ...

	./configure
	make
	make install

 ... and it's there.


The default license for the gimp-plugin-insanebump is an ultra-permissive
XFree-style license to encourage the use of the insanebump for GPL /or/
non-GPL plugins.

Happy GIMPing,
